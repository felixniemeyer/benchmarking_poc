# Benchmarking Demo

This is an implementation of a multi party computing protocol that informs all participants how they rank among each other regarding a specific metric, while nobody has to make his value public. An example use case would be millionaires figuring out who's richest without telling each other how rich they are.

Input: arbitrary number of parties P1,...Pn with inputs x1,...xn

## Note on the code

We use a library called JIFF for the computation. There are two possible approaches based on JIFF template app.

1. With sorting (merge sort) and then matching whoâ€™s value where in the sorted list. At the moment this way doesn't support proper ranking when several values being equal. (`computeWithSort`)
2. Direct rank calculation comparing everyone to everyone. (`computeCompare`)

To choose which one to use you need to change function name in `src/client.vue`.

## Valid inputs

This instantiation of benchmarking only supports positive integer inputs.

## Setup
1. Clone the [JIFF repo](https://github.com/multiparty/jiff) in the same directory as this repository. We don't use the jiff module from npm, because it's out of date.

1. Install dependencies
	```shell
	npm install
	```

2. Run webpack (only if you want to use the web client) 
	```shell
	npm run webpack-dev
	```
	for development or 
	```shell
	npm run webpack-prod
	```
for production

## Manual walkthrough

1. Run a server:
	```shell
	node server.js
	```
2. Per Participant you either 
	1. Open a web client: *http://localhost:8080/* in the browser or
	2. Use the `party.js` script by running
		```shell
		node party.js <input> [<party count> [<computation_id> [<party id>]]]
		```

## Testing 
```shell
npm test
```
Note that you *do not* need to have the server running when running the tests; they run the server on their own.

## File structure
The demo consists of the following parts:

1. Server script: *server.js*
2. Web Client (Webpack & Vue project):
    * *./src/*: Source files
    * *./dist/*: index.html and the webpacked *main.js* 
3. Node.js-Based Party:
    * *party.js*: Parses input from the command line and initializes the computation.
4. The MPC protocol: Implemented in *mpc.js*. This file is used by both the web client and `party.js`.
5. test.js: mocha unit tests.
6. Documentation:
    * This *README.md* file.
